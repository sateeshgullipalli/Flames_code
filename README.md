My first code on Github:

FLAMES is a game named after the acronym: Friends, Love, Affectionate, Marriage, Enemies , Sisters.
It is a popular game among teens who are beginning to explore the world of crushes. 
This game does not accurately predict whether or not an individual is right for you, but it can be fun to play this with your friends.
